*Animated bar plot showcasing the comparison between Experimental and Numerical Natural Frequencies.*

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook script that creates a dynamic bar plot animation using Matplotlib's `FuncAnimation`. The animation beautifully illustrates the comparison between Experimental and Numerical Natural Frequencies over time.

## Features

- Dynamic bar plot animation with enhanced design aesthetics.
- Clever use of text labels above bars for intuitive data representation.
- Modeled in Jupyter Notebook using Matplotlib's `FuncAnimation`.
- Clear comparison between Experimental and Numerical Natural Frequencies.
- Visual representation without cluttered y-axis.
